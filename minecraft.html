<center<h1> Minecraft</h1></center>
let me tell you about some servers in minecraft multiplayer:
<h2>Hypixel</h2><p>
<p>In this server there are multiple minigames you can play such as bedwars wich you have to protect your bed from other players and you have to break thier bed.<br>If your bed is broken you can't respawn, the way to win is to kill all the other people after breaking their beds. You can also do this in teams.<br>
<br>
Another minigame is blitz survival (this is my favourite personally) this is based of the hunger games <br>in which you have to fight other players in an areana as a fight to the death.
you can do this in teams or solo.<br>
<br> 
There is also a very popular game called skyblock which you are stuck on a floating piece of land and have to build and grow food to<br> survive.I also like this game as it helps people become creative in what they can do while stuck.</p>

<h2>Bendersmc</h2><p>
<p>This server is based of the hit netflix show Avatar in which people have 1 out of 4 bending abiltes and the avatar being able to<br> master them all.At the start you can choose your bending style earth,fire,water or air.I'm a waterbender which is quite stong the problem<br> is you have to be near a water source or a plant because you need water. <br>There is also chi blocking which is just regular fighting.Each elemant also have sub elememts which are part of it but allow different<br> abilties such as firebending for lighting bending earth for lavabeninf water for plant bening and air for soundbending.<br></p>
<br>
I really like these 2 servers and I hope you will too, goodbye.<h2><a href='index.html'>back</a></h2></p>
