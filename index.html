<h3>Minecraft</h3>
<p>
minecraft
 is a block themed game made about 11 years ago in 2012 created by notch.
a few years later it was bougt by microsoft from notch for 2 billon dollors
after that many updates were made to the game the latest being 1.20 and 1.21 coming out soon
the 1.20 update was the trails and tails update that added hanging signs archeolgy and my favourite the sniffer mob.
1.19 the wild update added the  mangrove swamp and the warden with frogs
1.18 the cave and cliffs update added the large caves with goats
 there are more updates but you can go to wikipeda for more
in this game there is also the multiplayer feature which allows you to play with your firends on servers which allow you to play with other people.
